# Three.js Particle Fluids

GPU particle physics for [three.js](https://threejs.org): liquids, soft bodies, cloth, and smoke, simulated and rendered with WebGPU.

**[Live demo](https://dgreenheck.github.io/threejs-particle-fluids/)** · **[Documentation](docs/README.md)** · **[API reference](docs/README.md#api-reference)**

## Install

```sh
npm install threejs-particle-fluids three
```

Requires three.js r184 and a browser with WebGPU (no WebGL fallback). See [Requirements](docs/guide.md#requirements).

## Quick start

```ts
import { Box3, Vector3 } from 'three';
import { Simulation, createParticleRenderer } from 'threejs-particle-fluids';

const renderer = await createParticleRenderer({ antialias: true });

const sim = new Simulation({
  renderer,
  scene,
  camera,
  container: new Box3(new Vector3(-0.5, 0, -0.3), new Vector3(0.5, 0.8, 0.3)),
  particles: 5000, // total budget; sets the cost of each step
});
sim.addFluid({ box: new Box3(new Vector3(-0.5, 0, -0.3), new Vector3(-0.1, 0.5, 0.3)) });

async function frame() {
  await sim.step();
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
  requestAnimationFrame(frame);
}
requestAnimationFrame(frame);
```

GPU tests and benchmarks need a local GPU; the runner passes Chrome's `--enable-unsafe-webgpu` flag. Benchmark results depend on the browser, adapter, and driver.
